  (* Hash support for [array] and [ref] is provided, but is potentially DANGEROUS, since
     it incorporates the current contents of the array/ref into the hash value.  Because
     of this we add a [_frozen] suffix to the function name.

     Hash support for [string] is also potentially DANGEROUS, but strings are mutated less
     often, so we don't append [_frozen] to it.

     Also note that we don't support [bytes].
